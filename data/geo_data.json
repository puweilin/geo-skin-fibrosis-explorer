    "Summary": "Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy affecting the skin and internal organs, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Injury of microvascular ECs in SSc impairs blood flow and causes tissue ischemia, leading to vascular complications such as Raynaud’s, digital ulcers, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). PH in SSc presents as group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or as group 3 PH related to hypoxia and interstitial lung disease (ILD), both major causes of mortality. Analysis of multiome data from SSc ILD-PH lungs inferred transcription factors regulating EC phenotype, including FOSL2. Overexpression of FOSL2 in transgenic mice (Fosl2tg) leads to vascular changes mirroring human SSc-PH, such as intimal thickening and fibrosis. ScRNA-seq analysis of altered EC gene expression in the Fosl2tg mice showed strong overlap with altered EC gene in SSc-ILD-PH. Overlapping as well as discrete EC gene expression in SuGene/hxpoxia- and hypoxia-treated mice suggested that FOSL2 regulates both hypoxia-dependent and independent pathways in Fosl2tg mice and SSc-ILD-PH. The deep learning model, ChromBPNet, inferred increased AP-1 binding at base pair resolution in SSc-ILDPH ECs and binding to the same motifs was found upon FOSL2 overexpression in primary vascular ECs, highlighting FOSL2’s key role in driving the pathological changes seen in SSc-ILDPH.",

    "Summary": "Background: Beyond its role as a ribosome-targeting antibiotic, linezolid was recently shown to modulate immune responses by inhibiting mitochondrial translation. Since mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in various fibrotic diseases, including systemic sclerosis (SSc), this study aimed to evaluate the antifibrotic potential of linezolid and delineate its underlying mechanisms in SSc. Methods: The effects of linezolid on fibrotic tissue remodeling were assessed using multiple experimental systems: human dermal fibroblasts, human macrophages, three-dimensional SSc skin equivalents (SScSE), the murine model of sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease (sclGvHD) and precision-cut skin slices (PCSS) obtained from SSc patients, by RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence, Western Blot and histology. Mitochondrial function was evaluated using Seahorse assays alongside mitochondrial protein synthesis assessments. Results: Linezolid inhibited TGFβ-induced fibroblast activation in cultured human fibroblasts, SScSE, sclGvHD mice and SSc PCSS, as demonstrated by reversal of profibrotic gene expression programs, downregulation of TGFβ, WNT, and JAK-STAT signaling and by reductions in αSMA expression or stress fiber formation, which led to reduced collagen deposition and ameliorated skin or lung fibrosis in vivo. Mechanistically, linezolid induced metabolic alterations by inhibiting mitochondrial translation in fibroblasts to hamper the oxidative phosphorylation, reduce the NAD⁺/NADH ratio and downregulate glycolysis, an essential metabolic pathway for fibroblast activation. Conclusions: This study provides first evidence that inhibiting mitochondrial translation with linezolid ameliorates fibrotic tissue remodeling. Since linezolid is already clinically approved as a reserve antibiotic, these findings hold translational promise and support the use of linezolid as a novel treatment for fibrotic disorders after further validation.",

    "Summary": "The activation of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) in fibroblasts has been implicated in wound healing and fibrosis; however, the role of RUNX1 in the fibrotic progression of the autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc) is not known. Leveraging gene expression, genome-wide DNA methylation, and single-cell resolution data of SSc skin and fibroblast, we analyzed the impact of RUNX1 dysregulation in SSc dermal fibrosis. RUNX1 function was subsequently assessed using siRNA, pharmacologic inhibition, and CRISPR knockout in 2D and 3D fibroblasts cultures. Analysis of gene expression in multiple cohorts demonstrated an association between the severity of dermal fibrosis and the expression levels of RUNX1 in the skin of patients with SSc. Epigenomic analyses of methylation identified hypomethylated CpG sites proximal to the RUNX1 gene, implicating their potential role in the increased expression of RUNX1. Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data from skin biopsies of individuals with SSc revealed that RUNX1 is higher in subpopulations of fibroblasts enriched in SSc, which are believed to contribute to fibrosis. RUNX1 CRISPR KO resulted in reduced alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression. Inhibition of RUNX1 activity caused a reduction in fibroblast activation, contraction, extracellular matrix components, and proliferation rates including a reduction in SFRP4, LUM and COL1A1. This study is the first to demonstrate a potential role for RUNX1 in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis dermal fibrosis. RUNX1 is associated with more severe SSc fibrosis and is associated with a subpopulation of dermal fibroblasts implicated in fibrosis.",

    "Summary": "Scleroderma is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by abnormal fibroblast proliferation and excessive collagen deposits in the skin and internal organs. We previously showed that esomeprazole, an FDA-approved drug for gastric disorders, may prevent dermal fibrosis. Here, we demonstrate that esomeprazole exerts anti-proliferative effects on scleroderma fibroblasts by interfering with cell cycle regulation. To test this, we evaluated the antiproliferative effect of esomeprazole and the underlying molecular mechanisms using primary fibroblasts derived from patients with scleroderma. BrdU incorporation, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis, RNA sequencing, and functional enrichment analysis all showed a decrease in fibroblast proliferation. In addition, esomeprazole inhibited the proliferation of scleroderma fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by the Ki-67 marker. Intriguingly, esomeprazole arrested fibroblasts in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, resulting in a reduction of cells in the S phase. Expression of p21, a known inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), was elevated, while CDK1 and CDK2 levels decreased following esomeprazole treatment. These data provide important insights into how esomeprazole regulates fibroblast proliferation in scleroderma and suggest that it may represent a potential therapeutic intervention for scleroderma.",

We generated an integrated multiomic dataset of early, treatment naïve dcSSc skin. Skin biopsies were analyzed by single-nuclei multiome sequencing (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) and two different paired spatial transcriptomic platforms to comprehensively describe the molecular changes in these individuals. We identified a proinflammatory niche within papillary, hypodermis, and vascular niches, that are enriched for activated myeloid cells and proinflammatory fibroblasts characterized by expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Pathway analyses showed significant enrichment of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway expression in these cellular niches, driven by profibrotic growth factor signaling networks. Macrophage subclustering showed SSc-specific macrophage activation of IL6-JAK-STAT signaling and the enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Ligand-receptor analysis revealed that SSc macrophages secrete PDGF and TGFB to activate the inflammatory SSc-dominant fibroblast subclusters. Spatial transcriptomic analyses showed infiltrating macrophages secreted PDGF and TGFB, modulating fibroblast activation in these niches. Multiomic data integration and spatial transcriptomic neighborhood analysis showed co-localization of fibroblasts, macrophages, and T cells around the vasculature. These data suggest that interactions between activated immune cells and proinflammatory fibroblasts around vascular niches are an early event in scleroderma pathogenesis.",

    "Summary": "Aberrant production of extracellular matrix (ECM) from dermal fibroblasts drives fibrotic skin diseases, which significantly affect the quality of patients’ lives. Current treatment options for skin fibrosis remain limited or ineffective; therefore, new antifibrotic strategies are urgently needed. Gaining insights into molecular control of ECM production could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets. Recent studies suggest Zinc Finger 469 (ZNF469) as a positive regulator for ECM production; however, its role in skin fibrosis has not been investigated. In this study, we found that knockdown of ZNF469 impaired proliferation, migration, and contraction in human dermal fibroblasts. More importantly, depletion of ZNF469 significantly caused a reduction in collagen production. RNA-sequence analysis of ZNF469-knockdown cells revealed significant suppression of several ECM genes and genes involved in the process of collagen biosynthesis, suggesting ZNF469 as a key regulator of ECM production. To find the clinical relevance, we examined expression of ZNF469 by reanalyzing public bulk and single-cell RNA-sequence data sets of hypertrophic scars and keloids as a representation of skin fibrosis. The RNA sequence of bulk tissues showed that hypertrophic scar and keloid tissues had higher levels of ZNF469 and that ZNF469 and ECM genes were positively correlated. Single-cell RNA sequence of keloid scars revealed restricted expression of ZNF469 in the fibroblast population. Further analysis of fibroblast subpopulations showed specific expression of ZNF469 in mesenchymal fibroblasts, a subpopulation that has been demonstrated to be crucial for collagen overexpression in keloids. Psuedotime analysis indicated ZNF469 as a pioneering factor to establish the mesenchymal fibroblast subpopulation. Supporting this finding, we observed downregulation of various mesenchymal fibroblast markers from our RNA sequence results of ZNF469-depleted dermal fibroblasts, suggesting ZNF469 as a crucial factor for maintaining mesenchymal phenotypes. Finally, to explore the therapeutic potential of ZNF469, we silenced it in human keloid fibroblasts and demonstrated that its depletion reduced proliferation, migration, contraction, and collagen production. Moreover, expression of key mesenchymal fibroblast markers was significantly downregulated in ZNF469-knockdown keloid fibroblasts. Together, we illustrated that ZNF469 promoted the ECM production in dermal fibroblasts and could serve as a novel target for treating skin fibrosis.",
    "Overall_Design": "To investigate the function and impact of ZNF469 on ECM production, ZNF469-knockdown human dermal fibroblasts cell lines were established with short-hairpin RNAs.

    "Summary": "Pathological scars, including hypertrophic scars and keloids, arise from excessive production and deposition of connective tissue such as collagen during wound healing, posing significant clinical challenges. Understanding the cellular and molecular dynamics underlying these scars is critical for developing effective therapies. Here, we integrate single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to characterize the cellular heterogeneity and molecular signatures of key scar-associated cell types, including pericytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Notably, we identify ECM-activated fibroblasts as a prominent subtype associated with pathological scarring. Cell-cell communication analysis reveals significantly enhanced interactions between fibroblasts and neural cells in pathological scars, especially in hypertrophic scars—a finding that aligns with clinical features such as fibrosis and pruritus. Moreover, we identify subtype-specific ligand-receptor pairs, including LAMB2–ITGA6 in hypertrophic scar and NLGN2–NRXN1 in keloid, mediating these fibroblast–neural communications. To support future research, we developed CellCellMarker 3.0, an updated and curated database integrating experimentally validated and transcriptomics-derived scar marker genes, along with ScarGPT, an intelligent Q&A system optimized using the DeepSeek R1 large language model, integrated with CellCellMarker data and a large corpus of scar-related publications.",

    "Summary": "Keloids comprise an inflammatory fibroproliferative skin disorder characterized by excessive scarring. Fibroblasts play a pivotal role in skin fibrosis, exhibiting heightened collagen deposition. To investigate the molecular drivers of excessive collagen deposition in keloid, we compared the transcriptome of keloids and adjacent normal skin which demonstrated significant shifts towards bone and cartilage lineages in keloids, along with RUNX2, a key regulator of osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, notably upregulated. We then confirmed elevated levels of RUNX2 protein and phosphorylated RUNX2 in keloid tissue and fibroblasts compared to normal skin and normal dermal fibroblasts. To delve into how RUNX2 overexpression could contribute to keloids pathogenesis, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of RUNX2 in keloid fibroblasts followed by mRNA-sequencing. The results revealed significant downregulation of collagen genes COL11A1, COL5A3, COL15A1, and COL6A6, in knock-down vs. control groups along with GO enrichment analysis showing perturbation of genes involved in collagen and ECM organization. Further functional studies utilizing Runx2-knockout mice confirmed downregulation of these collagen genes along with reduced dermis thickness and reduced total dermal collagen in Runx2-knockout vs. Runx2- wild mice. These findings underscore the critical contribution of RUNX2 to collagen remodeling in keloid and provide potential therapeutic target.",

    "Summary": "Immune driven fibrotic skin diseases including scleroderma/systemic sclerosis (SSc) and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD) cause skin stiffening that has major impact on patient quality of life and associated patient mortality. Therapies to improve sclerotic skin resulting from these diseases are largely ineffective. We previously showed that EREG, a DC3 dendritic cell-derived EGFR ligand, is elevated in the skin and lung of patients with SSc and required for maintenance of skin fibrosis. Here, we developed a fully human anti-EREG neutralizing antibody that has both high affinity and specificity. We found this therapeutic antibody to be functional and safe in vivo using human EREG knock-in mice. To understand the antifibrotic mechanism of targeting EREG, we aligned skin single-cell transcriptomic profiles of SSc, morphea (localized scleroderma) and SclGvHD with disease biomarkers. EREG expression in the skin was elevated in all three fibrotic diseases and a driver of TNC production by myofibroblasts in all three fibrotic diseases. TNC is a pro-inflammatory extracellular glycoprotein that functions as an endogenous TLR4 ligand which induces expression of TLR4 target genes CCL2 and IL6. Examination of skin explants from patients with active SclGvHD treated with anti-EREG therapeutic antibody by spatial transcriptomics demonstrated upregulation of matrix degradation by increased MMP and decreased TIMP1 expression. Protein measurements showed reduced secretion of EREG targets TNC, CCL2, and TIMP1 in all patients, and type I collagen and FN1 in 3/4 patients. Thus, sclerotic skin treated with the anti-EREG therapeutic antibody reduced inflammatory and fibrosis biomarkers associated with EGFR and TLR4 signaling.",

    "Summary": "Dermal fibrosis is a significant barrier to effective wound healing, with excessive myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix deposition leading to scar formation and compromised tissue function. Current in vitro models for studying dermal fibrosis, such as monolayer cultures and human skin equivalents (HSEs), have limited physiological relevance or scalability for drug screening. Here, we present a dermis-on-a-chip platform to enable screening of anti-fibrotic compounds in physiologically-relevant 3D dermal microtissues. Upon treatment with transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), the tissues exhibited hallmarks of fibrosis, including impaired integrity, increased tensile forces, altered cellular morphology, and a pro-fibrotic cytokine profile. Conversely, incorporation of QHREDGS (Q-peptide), an angiopoietin-1 derived peptide with known regenerative properties, selectively modulated these fibrotic changes. Q-peptide was found to reduce TGFβ-induced tensile forces, suppress smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression, and upregulate certain cytokines associated with wound repair. Overall, these findings demonstrate the utility of dermis-on-a-chip model in compound screening.",

    "Summary": "Activation of fibroblasts and formation of myofibroblasts are essential for granulation tissue formation following injury. In fibrotic reactions, excessive deposition of ECM by the activated fibroblasts determines scar formation and functional failure. Although these events critically depend on the activity of a plethora of growth factors and cytokines, TGFβ1 is a unique player controlling the immune response and proliferation of many cell types. Different cell types contribute to its release and activation, which is also regulated by the interaction with the ECM and by mechanical forces. The aim of this study was to elaborate whether fibroblast-derived TGFβ1 plays a critical role during these processes. The data demonstrate a dynamic expression of TGFβ1 during tissue repair. Cell-specific ablation of Tgfb1 in fibroblasts revealed that deletion of TGFβ1 attenuates bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis and delays maturation of granulation tissue in skin wounds. Absence of fibroblast-derived TGFβ1 induced vascular alterations (less vascular density and branching, hemorrhage) in early wound healing, potentially influenced by coincident alterations in the formation of stable ECM structure. This can be explained by paracrine regulation of endothelial cells or pericytes by fibroblast-released TGFβ1 and by impaired expression of pro-angiogenic factors in TGFβ1-deficient fibroblasts. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the central role of fibroblast-derived TGFβ1 for early stages of tissue repair and fibrosis in the skin.",

    "Summary": "Secondary lymphedema is characterized by fibrosis and impaired lymphatic function. Although TGF-β is a key regulator of fibrosis in this disease, the cellular mechanisms regulating this process remain unknown. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT), a mechanism by which TGF-β induces fibrosis in other skin diseases, is characterized by loss of epithelial cell markers and cellular polarity, upregulation of fibrotic gene expression, and gain of migratory capacity. Using clinical lymphedema biopsy specimens and animal models, we show that keratinocytes in the basal layer of epidermis undergo EMT in lymphedematous skin, migrate into the dermis, and contribute to dermal fibrosis. In vitro studies using cultured primary human keratinocytes treated with lymphatic fluid from the affected limbs of patients with secondary lymphedema resulted in a TGF-β-mediated increased expression of EMT markers. We show for the first time that EMT is activated by TGF-β in secondary lymphedema and that this process plays an important role in regulating skin fibrosis in this disease.",

    "Summary": "Hypertrophic scar (HS) is a somatopsychic disease that significantly affects quality of life. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds promise for HS treatment, while challenges like poor transdermal delivery and rapid metabolism into non_xfffe_photosensitive heme restrict its effectiveness. Inspired by the natural phenomenon of a whale fall nourishing life, this study innovatively repurposes 5-ALA metabolic waste, heme, as a “whale-like” energy source to drive ferroptosis, thus establishing a zero-waste therapy. This is achieved by encapsulating 5-ALA and baicalin within human H-ferritin (HFn), subsequently incorporated into polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) microneedles (FAB@MN). The FAB@MN exhibits excellent targeting towards hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs) with pH-responsive programmed drug release. Upon application, 5-ALA is converted into PpIX to initiate PDT. Subsequently, baicalin is released, triggering ferroptosis while also synergizing with the ROS and heme accumulated during PDT to overstimulate the HO-1-heme metabolic axis. This activation releases Fe2+ and CO, further potentiating ferroptosis. Moreover, the enhanced ferroptotic response driven by FAB@MN induces mitophagy, leading to increased Fe²⁺ release from the mitochondria. Unlike conventional PDT only focuses on immediate effects, this approach uses 5-ALA photodynamic waste to fuel a sustained ferroptosis response post-PDT, offering new avenues for HS treatments.",
    "Overall_Design": "This research project has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University (CQHS-REC-2024-058). Nine HS tissues and the matched normal skin tissues were provided by patients undergoing surgical treatment, and each patient has voluntarily signed an informed consent form. All participants in this study did not have any known systemic diseases and were not receiving any treatments that could potentially affect the study results. In brief, tissues were first cut into 3 mm-thick slices, and then digested overnight with 0.25% neutral protease II. Subsequently, the epidermal layer was peeled off, and further digestion was carried out for 4-6 hours at 37Â°C with 0.2% Collagenase II. After digestion, cells were filtered and collected using a cell strainer with a 75Î¼m pore size, then resuspended in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and cultured at 37Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The method of isolating fibroblasts from normal skin was similar to the aforementioned process for obtaining HSFs with minor modifications. HSFs were seeded at a density of 1 Ã 10^5 cells/well in a 24-well plate and cultured for 24 hours in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Subsequently, the cells were treated with FAB NPs for 4 hours, followed by 10 mins of illumination, and then incubated for another 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), and the integrity of the RNA was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). RNA samples were prepared using total RNA as a template. Initially, mRNA was extracted from total RNA using magnetic beads coated with poly-T oligonucleotides. This mRNA was then fragmented under high temperatures in the presence of divalent cations, using a 5X First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer. The synthesis of the first cDNA strand was achieved using random hexamer primers and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-). This was followed by the synthesis of the second cDNA strand using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Exonuclease and polymerase activities were employed to transform remaining overhangs into blunt ends. Subsequent to the adenylation of the 3' ends of the DNA fragments, adapters containing hairpin loop structures were attached, setting the stage for hybridization. cDNA fragments ranging in size from 370-420 bp were isolated using the AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Amplification of these fragments was then carried out using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, along with universal PCR primers and an Index (X) Primer. The PCR products were purified within the AMPure XP system, and the library's quality was evaluated using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Indexed samples were clustered on the cBot Cluster Generation System using the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Post-clustering, the library was sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq platform, producing 150 bp paired-end reads and thereby acquiring the sequence data of the fragments.",

    "Summary": "Keloids are characterized by persistent scar tissue growth that causes abnormal sensory perceptions due to mechanical stress. But the molecular dysfunction and disease-specific cells that fashion keloid pathophysiology are still not evident. Here, we found a distinct subpopulation of fibroblasts with enhanced expression of PIEZO2 in the dermal layer of keloid patients experiencing dysesthesia, including pain and pressure-tactile itch. The PIEZO2-expressing fibroblasts exhibited a keloid-typical phenotype marked by increased extracellular matrix production signaling and higher levels of collagens such as COL1A1, COL1A2, and COL3A1 compared with other fibroblasts. Notably, patients with higher PIEZO2 expression tend to experience keloid recurrence more quickly after keloidectomy (4/5 vs. 0/5, p = 0.047) than those with lower PIEZO2 expression. Thus, the PIEZO2-positive fibroblasts are indicative cells that most accurately reflect the keloid characteristics, suggesting the driving role for the persistent growth of Keloids.",

    "Summary": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common form of hair loss characterized by follicular miniaturization, dermal fibrosis, and low-grade immune activation, yet the precise mediators linking androgen signaling to these tissue-level changes remain poorly defined. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the skin microenvironment in a testosterone-induced mouse model of AGA and assess the therapeutic impact of a CXCL12-neutralizing antibody. We find that androgen receptor-positive dermal fibroblasts are the principal source of CXCL12, which acts in an autocrine manner via ACKR3 to drive TGF-β–mediated extracellular matrix deposition. In parallel, CXCL12 signals through CXCR4 to reprogram a Sox2+ Twist1+ dermal papilla cell population toward a fibrotic, low-inductive state and expand a pro-fibrotic Trem2+ macrophage subset. Blockade of CXCL12 reverses these transcriptional and cellular alterations across stromal, follicular, and immune compartments, restoring a regenerative skin niche and supporting hair regrowth. These findings position CXCL12 as a central mediator of fibroimmune remodeling in AGA and establish its neutralization as a promising therapeutic strategy.",

However, its significance in clinical stratification and contribution to deterioration still need to be better understood. For hypothesis generation, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on skin biopsies (SSc=4, control =2) using the BD Rhapsody platform. The IFN-1 signature was mapped, functionally investigated in a bleomycin plus IFNα2-adeno-associated virus (IFNA2-AAV) induced model, and verified in an SSc cohort (n=61). Endothelial cells (EC) had the most prominent IFN-1 signature among dermal non-immune cells. The EC IFN-1 signature was increased both in SSc vs. controls and in dcSSc vs. lcSSc. IFNA2-AAV deteriorated bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis, EndoMT, and perivascular fibrosis and caused blood vessel loss with EC apoptosis. Vascular MX1, an IFN-1 response protein, was significantly increased both in total SSc skin vs. healthy controls and in dcSSc vs. lcSSc. Baseline vascular MX1 performed similarly to skin score in predicting disease progression over 6-34 months in total SSc and was superior in the dcSSc subpopulation. To sum up, the EC IFN-1 signature distinguished SSc skin subtypes and disease progression and may contribute to vasculopathy and fibrosis.",

    "Summary": "Keloid is benign skin tumor, and their curing is relatively difficult due to the unclear mechanism of formation. Inducing ferroptosis of keloid fibroblasts (KFs) may become a new method for treating keloid. Here, we discover interferon (IFN)γ could induce KFs ferroptosis through inhibiting SPOC domain-containing protein 1 (SPOCD1), serving as a mode of action for CD8+T cell (CTL)-mediated keloid killing. Mechanistically, keloid IFNγ deficiency in combination with reduced DNMT3A increase the expression of SPOCD1, thereby promoting KFs’ proliferation and inhibiting its ferroptosis. Moreover, keloid SPOCD1 deficiency attenuates KFs progression and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Reducing IFNγ and SPOCD1 simultaneously can increase the positive rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promote mitochondrial shrinkage. Ex-vivo explant keloid culture has also confirmed that the reduction of SPOCD1 helps to reduce the proliferation rate of KFs, inhibit the angiogenesis of keloid scars, and thus inhibit keloid formation. Thus, IFNγ signaling paired with SPOCD1 is a natural keloid ferroptosis promoting mechanism and a mode of action of CTLs. Targeting SPOCD1 pathway is a potential anti-keloid approach.",

In recent years, the impact of the peripheral immune microenvironment on keloid has garnered significant attention in scholarly investigations exploring the underlying pathogenesis of this condition. In this study, we isolated CD45+ cells from keloid and normal scar dermis tissues by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Our results revealed the intricate cellular landscape of immune cells in keloid. We found that compared to normal scar tissue, the percentage of Th17 cells was significantly increased in keloid. Further functional studies revealed that Th17 cell promotes proliferation, migration and collagen expression of keloid fibroblast through IL17a. These findings will help us more thoroughly understand keloid pathogenesis and provide potential targets for keloid therapies.",

    "Summary": "Keloids are benign fibroproliferative tumours resulting from skin damage such as trauma, burns or surgery. Keloids are more prevalent in populations with darkly pigmented skin. Links between skin pigmentation and vitamin D production have been established and some studies indicate involvement of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. This study assessed the impact of paricalcitol (a selective vitamin D signalling activator) on fibroblasts derived from keloid and normal skin, to further investigate the role and potential clinical relevance of vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology. Analysis of keloid and normal skin tissue using immunohistochemistry demonstrated a significant reduction of nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) in keloid tissue. After treatment with paricalcitol, nuclear VDR was increased in both keloid and normal fibroblasts. RNA sequencing of normal fibroblasts treated with paricalcitol demonstrated significant changes in gene expression, with many upregulated genes identified to have anti-fibrotic effects. However, paricalcitol failed to alter gene expression in Keloid fibroblasts. To investigate this further, we performed RNA sequencing of normal and keloid fibroblasts and found that retinoid-X receptor α (RXRα), a key binding partner of VDR required for downstream transcriptional activation, is significantly downregulated in keloid fibroblasts. Our results indicate that paricalcitol can effectively activate VDR translocation to the nucleus but is unable to effect change at the transcriptional level in keloid fibroblasts, most likely due to the reduced expression of RXRα. This suggests Vitamin D signalling may be aberrant in keloids, and that supplementation with Vitamin D alone would likely be ineffective in restoring signalling. Keywords: Keloid, Vitamin D receptor, Paricalcitol, Retinoid-X receptor α",
    "Overall_Design": "To investigate the role of Vitamin D signalling in keloid pathology, we treated normal and keloid skin fibroblasts with the Vitamin D activator Paricalcitol and compared the changes in gene expression to untreated fibroblasts from the same patients.

    "Summary": "Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is a mucocutaneous blistering disease due to type VII collagen gene mutations. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-dependent fibrosis is responsible for severe RDEB complications. Reduced histone acetylation is a hallmark of fibrosis in pathologies affecting organs other than skin, where inhibition of histone deacetylses (HDACs) proved effective in reverting fibrosis. Here, HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) ability to counteract RDEB progression was investigated. We found that histone acetylation is decreased in RDEB skin and fibroblasts. Treatment with two HDACis, valproic acid (VPA) and Givinostat, counteracts RDEB fibroblast fibrotic traits, including contractility, α-smooth muscle actin expression, TGF-β1 release, and proliferation. Moreover, systemic VPA administration mitigates severe manifestations (corneal opacification and digit loss) in a RDEB mouse model. This effect associates with inhibition of skin fibrosis (presence of subcutaneous fat, thinner collagen bundles, decreased expression of fibrotic markers). Proteomic analysis of mouse skin revealed that VPA treatment decreases expression of genes involved in protein synthesis and increases levels of proteins with role in immune response. These findings highlight epigenetic changes as contributing to RDEB pathogenesis and disclose molecular mechanisms leading to skin fibrosis. Treatment with HDACi may represent a disease modifier therapeutic approach for RDEB and other skin fibrotic disorders.",
    "Overall_Design": "To investigate the effect of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) on RDEB progression, fibroblasts were obtained from 5 RDEB patients.

    "Summary": "Keloids are pathological fibroproliferative scars resulting from abnormal collagen deposition within and beyond the margins of the initial cutaneous insult. Keloids negatively impact quality of life cosmetically and functionally and have unsatisfactory treatment modalities with adverse side effects and high reoccurrence rates. Recent studies indicate that epigenetic dysregulation is involved in the development and progression of keloids, suggesting that this could be a viable therapeutic target. The purpose of this study was to evaluate epigenetic targeting drugs, HDACi, LSD1i, Corin, and A-485, as potential therapies for keloids using in-vitro model systems with patient-derived keloid fibroblasts. Results demonstrated that both dual-acting CoREST inhibitor, corin, and HDAC inhibitor, MS-275, reduced fibroblast proliferation more than the LSD1 inhibitor. Corin was the most effective inhibitor of keloid fibroblast migration and invasion across keloid cell lines and primary cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that corin treatment upregulated a significant number of genes with an enrichment in neural differentiation and cell adhesion gene sets. Specifically, corin increased the expression of claudins, which may cause increased cell adhesion and contribute to corin-induced reductions in migration and invasion. Corin downregulated gene sets involved in cell cycle progression, confirmed by reductions in Cyclin A1 and Cyclin B2 at the protein level compared to DMSO.

    "Summary": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by intractable multiorgan fibrosis caused by vascular and immune dysfunction. Currently, effective therapeutic options for patients with SSc are limited. Nitrate, an abundant nutrient in the diet, has been demonstrated to be preventative and therapeutic for several diseases. To determine whether nitrate can slow or reverse SSc progression, topical application of nitrate delivered by dissolving microneedles was used to treat a bleomycin (BLM)-induced dermal fibrosis mouse model. In this study, nitrate considerably attenuated dermal thickness, stiffness, and collagen deposition.To examine the nitrate regulation of gene expression at the genome-wide level, bulk RNA sequencing of skin was performed. Bulk RNA sequencing of skin revealed that Cd4 was a key hub gene in SSc nitrate therapy. Additionally, BLM-induced cytokines and chemokines were inhibited by nitrate, and CD4+ T cells infiltration markedly declined. Il4, Il6, Il13, and Tgfb expression in CD4+ T cells isolated from skin biopsies also significantly decreased. Mechanistically, Il1rl1, a type2 immune response inducer, was markedly repressed in isolated CD4+ T cells and dermal tissues after nitrate treatment. Remarkably, compared with wild type mice, mice lacking Il1rl1 showed impaired transcriptional profiles after intradermal BLM injection. Adoptive transfer of ST2+CD4+ T cells promoted bleomycin-induced Rag2-/- mice dermal fibrosis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that nitrate targeting ST2+CD4+ T cells is an effective therapeutic option for SSc.",

    "Summary": "Background: The IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP) is an essential co-receptor required for signaling through the IL-1, IL-33 and IL-36 receptors. Here, we investigate the antifibrotic potential of the combined inhibition of these cytokines by an anti-IL1RAP antibody to provide a scientific background for clinical development in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods: The expression of IL1RAP-associated signaling molecules was determined by data mining of publicly available RNAseq data as well as by imaging mass cytometry (IMC). Efficacy of therapeutic dosing of anti-IL1RAP antibodies was determined in three complimentary mouse models: chronic sclerodermatous graft-versus-host-disease (cGvHD), bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis model and topoisomerase-I (topo)-induced fibrosis. Results: SSc skin showed upregulation of IL1RAP and IL1RAP-related signaling molecules on mRNA and protein level compared to normal skin. IL-1, IL-33, and IL-36 all regulate distinct genes sets related to different pathophysiological processes in SSc. The responses of human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to IL-1, IL-33, and IL-36 were completely blocked by treatment with an anti-IL1RAP-antibody in vitro. Moreover, anti-IL1RAP antibody treatment reduced dermal and pulmonary fibrosis in cGvHD-, bleomycin- and topoisomerase-induced fibrosis. Importantly, RNAseq analyses revealed effects of IL1RAP inhibition on multiple processes related to inflammation and fibrosis that are also deregulated in human SSc skin. Conclusion: This study provides first evidence for the therapeutic benefits of targeting of IL1RAP in SSc. Our findings have high translational potential as the anti-IL1RAP antibody CAN10 has recently entered a phase 1 clinical trial.",

    "Summary": "Objectives: Eph/Ephrin cell-cell signaling is emerging as a key player in tissue fibrogenesis. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 mediates dermal fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods: We assessed normal and SSc human skin biopsies for EphB2 expression. The in vivo role of EphB2 in skin fibrosis was investigated by subjecting EphB2-knockout mice to both bleomycin-induced and tight skin (Tsk1/+) genetic mouse models. EphB2 kinase-dead and overactive point mutant mice were used to evaluate the role of EphB2 forward signaling in bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis. In vitro studies were performed on dermal fibroblasts from SSc patients and healthy controls, which was followed by in vivo analysis of fibroblast-specific EphB2 deficient mice. Results: Expression of EphB2 is upregulated in SSc skin tissue and explanted SSc dermal fibroblasts compared to healthy controls. EphB2 expression is elevated in two animal models of dermal fibrosis. In mice, EphB2 drives dermal fibrosis in both the bleomycin and the Tsk1/+ models of skin fibrosis. EphB2 forward signaling is a critical mediator of dermal fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) cytokines upregulate EphB2 in dermal fibroblasts via non-canonical TGFβ/SMAD signaling and silencing EphB2 in dermal fibroblasts is sufficient to dampen TGFβ-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation. Moreover, mice with fibroblast-specific deletion of EphB2 showed impaired fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation and reduced skin fibrosis upon bleomycin challenge. Conclusion: Our data implicate EphB2 overexpression and kinase-mediated forward signaling in the development of dermal fibrosis in SSc. EphB2 thus represents a potential new therapeutic target for SSc.",

Histologically, AK is characterized by mixed leukocytic infiltrates in the acute stage followed by a granulomatous reaction and extensive fibrosis in later stages. To further explore its pathogenesis, bulk RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing were applied to scalp biopsy specimens of lesional and adjacent non-lesional skin in patients with clinically active disease. Unbiased clustering revealed 18 distinct cell populations, including two notable populations, POSTN+ fibroblasts with enriched extracellular matrix signatures, and SPP1+ myeloid cells M2 macrophages. Cell communication analyses indicate that fibroblasts and myeloid cells communicate by collagen and SPP1 signaling networks in lesional skin. Tissue immunofluorescence staining demonstrated SPP1+ myeloid cells and POSTN+ fibroblasts at the upper segment of outer root sheath of the hair follicle in the subacute stage, confirming micro-anatomic specificity with relevant disease activity. Therapy with intralesional corticosteroids reduced SPP1 and POSTN expression, and lessened AK progression. In summary, the communication between POSTN+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ myeloid cells by collagen and SPP1 axis may contribute to the pathogenesis of AK.",

    "Summary": "Keloids are characterized by abnormal wound healing with excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix. Myofibroblasts are the primary contributor to extracellular matrix secretion, playing an essential role in the wound healing process. However, the differences between myofibroblasts involved in keloid formation and normal wound healing remain unclear. To identify the specific characteristics of keloid myofibroblasts, we initially assessed the expression levels of well-established myofibroblast markers, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transgelin (TAGLN), in scar and keloid tissues (n = 63 and 51, respectively). The objective was to evaluate the enrichment of myofibroblasts in these tissues. Although myofibroblasts were present in significant quantities in keloids and immature scars, they were absent in mature scars. Next, we conducted RNA sequencing using myofibroblast-rich areas from keloids and immature scars to investigate the difference in RNA expression profiles among myofibroblasts. Comparison of the results with publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets revealed that 112 genes were significantly upregulated and 108 genes were downregulated in keloid samples compared with immature scar samples. Among them, KN motif and ankyrin repeat domains 4 (KANK4) was identified as a specifically upregulated gene in keloids. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that KANK4 protein was expressed in myofibroblasts in keloid tissues; however, it was not expressed in any myofibroblasts in immature scar tissues. There are two main isoforms of KANK4 transcripts, with short isoforms being dominantly expressed in keloid tissue. Overexpression of the short isoform of KANK4 enhanced cell mobility in keloid myofibroblasts. Our results suggest that the KANK4-mediated increase in myofibroblast mobility contributes to keloid pathogenesis.",

    "Summary": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a devastating autoimmune disease characterized by excessive production and accumulation of extracellular matrix, leading to fibrosis of skin and other internal organs. However, the main cellular participants in SSc skin fibrosis remain incompletely understood. Here using differentiation trajectories at a single cell level, we demonstrate a dual source of extracellular matrix deposition in SSc skin from both myofibroblasts and endothelial-to-mesenchymal-transitioning cells (EndoMT). We further define a central role of Hippo pathway effectors in differentiation and homeostasis of myofibroblast and EndoMT, respectively, and show that myofibroblasts and EndoMTs act as central communication hubs that drive key pro-fibrotic signaling pathways in SSc. Together, our data help characterize myofibroblast differentiation and EndoMT phenotypes in SSc skin, and hint that modulation of the Hippo pathway may contribute in reversing the pro-fibrotic phenotypes in myofibroblasts and EndoMTs.",

Cells were cultured on collagen coated polyacrylamide hydrogels with elastic moduli mimicking normal skin (8 kPa) or keloid scar tissue (214 kPa), and changes in gene expression were profiled using next-generation RNA-sequencing. Differential gene expression analysis identified overall significant differences in gene expression between the NDF and KDF populations. Despite high levels of inter-patient heterogeneity in the KDF samples, further principal components analysis revealed a subset of genes (PC5) that were specifically regulated by ECM rigidity. Gene set enrichment analysis of the PC5 genes identified classic pathways associated with mechanotransduction, including Hippo Signalling and Regulation of the Actin Cytoskeleton, as well as genes associated with the Autophagy pathway. Additional in vitro studies and human tissue staining confirmed the biomechanical regulation of autophagic flux in NDFs and KDFs and differential remodelling of the lysosome in KDFs and keloid scars. Together, these findings implicate autophagy and lysosomal remodelling as biomechanically dysregulated pathways in keloid fibroblasts, and these mechanisms may contribute to scar pathogenesis.",

The terpenoid celastrol has recently been identified as a YAP1 inhibitor: however, if celastrol can alleviate SSc fibrosis is unknown. Methods: Human dermal fibroblasts from healthy individuals and patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc were treated with or without transforming growth factor b1 (TGFb1) in the presence or absence of celastrol. C57BL6J mice were subjected to the inflammatory-driven bleomycin-induced model of skin SSc, in the presence or absence of celastrol.

Results: In dermal fibroblasts, celastrol impaired the ability of TGFβ1 to induce an SSc-like pattern of gene expression, including the induction of cellular communication network factor 2 (CCN2), collagen I and TGFβ1 protein. Celastrol alleviated the persistent fibrotic phenotype of dermal fibroblasts cultured from lesions of SSc patients. In the bleomycin-induced model of SSc dermatopathology, celastrol inhibited fibrosis and blocked nuclear localization of YAP in myofibroblasts.

    "Summary": "Hypertrophic scars arise from dysregulated wound healing under prolonged mechanical tension, causing disfiguring fibrosis. However, limited preclinical models replicate key features of human tension-induced scarring. We developed an innovative murine model utilizing suture anchoring to impose persistent transverse-axial stretch across healing incisions, mimicking excessive wound tension that leads to hypertrophy clinically. Dorsal paired incisions were generated in mice, with wound edges on the upper back sutured to the rib cage while leaving wound edges on the lower back relaxed. This localized anchoring restrained wound contraction, maintaining high tension throughout remodeling analogous to scars widening under stress. Stretched upper wounds developed profound fibrotic changes compared to relaxed controls. Scars induced by suture-anchored tension displayed macroscopic hypertrophy, hardness, erythema, and pruritis up to 3 months. Histologically, scars induced by suture-anchored tension were hypercellular, hypervascular, hyperproliferative with disorganized extracellular matrix deposition, and displayed molecular hallmarks of hypertrophic fibrosis. MRNA sequencing revealed the fibrogenic signature in suture-anchored tension induced hypertrophic scars, which exhibited transcriptional overlap with mechanically-stretched scars, human hypertrophic and keloid scars.",

    "Summary": "Fibrosis is regulated by interactions between immune and mesenchymal cells. However, the capacity of cell types to modulate human fibrosis pathology is poorly understood due to lack of a fully humanized model system. MISTRG6 mice were engineered by homologous mouse/human gene replacement to develop an immune system like humans when engrafted with human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) (1, 2). We utilized MISTRG6 mice to model scleroderma by transplantation of healthy or scleroderma skin from a patient with pansclerotic morphea to humanized mice engrafted with unmatched allogeneic HSC. We discovered that scleroderma skin grafts contained both skin and bone marrow derived human CD4 and CD8 T cells along with human endothelial cells and pericytes. Unlike healthy skin, fibroblasts in scleroderma skin were depleted and replaced by mouse fibroblasts. Furthermore, HSC engraftment alleviated multiple signatures of fibrosis, including expression of collagen and interferon genes, and proliferation and activation of human T cells. Fibrosis improvement correlated with reduced markers of T cell activation and expression of human IL-6 by mesenchymal cells. Mechanistic studies supported a model whereby IL-6 trans-signaling driven by CD4 T cell derived soluble IL-6 receptor complexed with fibroblast derived IL-6 promoted excess ECM gene expression. Thus, MISTRG6 mice transplanted with scleroderma skin demonstrated multiple fibrotic responses centered around human IL-6 signaling, which was improved by the presence of healthy bone marrow derived immune cells. Our results highlight the importance of IL-6 trans-signaling in pathogenesis of scleroderma and the ability of healthy bone marrow derived immune cells to mitigate disease.",

    "Summary": "Hypertrophic scar (HS) is a skin fibroproliferative disease currently having no truly effective therapy. PIK3CA is a catalytic subunit of PI3K able to promote collagen synthesis in benign fibrotic diseases and to regulate cell survival, proliferation, and adhesion in malignancies. To explore PIK3CA’s functions in HS formation, we performed transcriptome sequencing and experimental validation. PIK3CA were overexpressed in HS tissues, and positively correlated with fibrosis. We then screened out miR-203a-3p as the most suitable endogenous inhibitor of PIK3CA through bioinformatics. Intriguingly, miR-203a-3p suppressed the proliferation, migration, collagen synthesis, and contractility, as well as trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in vitro, improved the morphology and histology of HS in vivo. Mechanistically, miR-203a-3p attenuated fibrosis by inactivating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway via directly targeting PIK3CA. In conclusion, Our findings identified that PIK3CA and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were actively involved in HS formation and demonstrated that miR-203a-3p might serve as a potential strategy for HS therapy through targeting PIK3CA and inactivating PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",

    "Summary": "Keloids represent a fibrotic disorder characterized by the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the mechanisms by which ECM deposition in keloids is regulated remain elusive. Here, we found that the expression of both TWEAK and its cognate receptor Fn14 was significantly downregulated in keloids and that TWEAK/Fn14 signaling repressed the expression of ECM-related genes in keloid fibroblasts. The IRF1 gene was essential for this repression, and the TWEAK/Fn14 downstream transcription factor P65 directly bound to the promoter of the IRF1 gene and induced its expression. Furthermore, in keloid patients, the expression of TWEAK and Fn14 was negatively correlated with that of ECM genes and positively correlated with that of IRF1. These observations indicate that relief of TWEAK/Fn14/IRF1-mediated ECM deposition repression contributes to keloid pathogenesis, and the identified mechanism and related molecules provide potential targets for keloid treatment in the future.",

    "Summary": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a pleiotropic peptide produced in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Despite conjectures that NPY may have a role in skin physiology and pathology, the effects of NPY in this organ remain poorly understood. We reported that a knock-in mouse with entopic NPY overexpression exhibits significantly elevated NPY in the skin, accompanied by premature and progressive hair graying secondary to depletion of melanocyte stem cells within hair follicles. However, the question remains as to whether NPY overexpression in the skin can induce non-melanocyte pathology. In this study, we employed this mouse to investigate consequences of skin-specific overexpression of NPY. Our findings show that chronic NPY overexpression in the skin induces dermal fibrosis and epidermal hyperkeratosis. Additionally, NPY overexpression induces significant accumulation of macrophages and T-regs in the dermis. RNA sequencing of whole skin from NPY-overexpressing mice further reveals NPY-mediated transcriptional changes consistent with inflammatory processes and inflammation-associated skin changes. Together, these results provide long-awaited evidence of NPY’s involvement in skin pathology, providing a background for future precise definition of its role in the regulation of cutaneous homeostasis.",

    "Summary": "Hypertrophic scar (HS) is a fibrotic skin condition and characterized by abnormal proliferation of myofibroblasts and accumulation of extracellular matrix. Melatonin, an endogenous hormone, can alleviate fibrosis in multiple models of diseases. This study examined the effect of melatonin on fibrosis in primary fibroblasts from human HS (HSFs) and a rabbit ear model and potential mechanisms. Melatonin treatment significantly decreased the migration and contraction capacity, collagen and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) production in HSFs. RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses indicated that melatonin modulated the expression of genes involved in autophagy and oxidative stress. Mechanistically, melatonin treatment attenuated the AKT/mTOR activation through affecting the binding of MT2 receptor with PI3K to enhance autophagy, decreasing fibrogenic factor production in HSFs. Moreover, melatonin treatment inhibited HS formation in rabbit ears by enhancing autophagy. The anti-fibrotic effects of melatonin were abrogated by treatment with an autophagy inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA), an Akt activator (SC79), or an MT2 selective antagonist (4-phenyl-2propionamidotetralin, 4-P-PDOT). Therefore, melatonin may be a potential drug for prevention and treatment of HS.",

    "Summary": "Purpose: The present study was carried out to investigate the global m6A modified RNA pattern and possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of keloid. Method: 14 normal skin and 14 keloid tissue were firstly collected on clinic. Then 3 samples from each group were randomly selected to be verified with the Western Blot to determine the level of methyltransferase and demethylase. The total RNA of all samples in each group was isolated and subjected to the analysis of MeRIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing. With the software of MeTDiff and htseq-count, the m6A peaks and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined within the fold change > 2 and p -value < 0.05. The top 10 pathways of m6A modified genes in each group and the differentially-expressed genes were enriched by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways. Finally, the closely associated pathway was determined with the Western Blot and immunofluorescence staining. Results: There was a higher protein level of WTAP and Mettl3 in the keloid than in the normal tissue. 21,020 unique m6A peaks with 6573 unique m6A-associated genetic transcripts appeared in the keloid samples. In the normal tissue, 4028 unique m6A peaks with 779-associated modified genes appeared in the keloid. In the RNA-sequencing, there were 847 genes significantly changed between these groups, transcriptionally. The genes with m6A methylated modification and the upregulated differentially expressed genes between two tissues were both mainly related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, the hyper-m6A modified Wnt / β-catenin pathway in keloid was verified with western blotting. From immunofluorescence staining results, we found that the accumulated fibroblasts were under a hyper-m6A condition in the keloid and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was mainly activated in the fibroblasts.

    "Summary": "Purpose: The present study was carried out to investigate the global m6A modified RNA pattern and possible mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of keloid. Method: 14 normal skin and 14 keloid tissue were firstly collected on clinic. Then 3 samples from each group were randomly selected to be verified with the Western Blot to determine the level of methyltransferase and demethylase. The total RNA of all samples in each group was isolated and subjected to the analysis of MeRIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing. With the software of MeTDiff and htseq-count, the m6A peaks and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined within the fold change > 2 and p -value < 0.05. The top 10 pathways of m6A modified genes in each group and the differentially-expressed genes were enriched by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signaling pathways. Finally, the closely associated pathway was determined with the Western Blot and immunofluorescence staining. Results: There was a higher protein level of WTAP and Mettl3 in the keloid than in the normal tissue. 21,020 unique m6A peaks with 6573 unique m6A-associated genetic transcripts appeared in the keloid samples. In the normal tissue, 4028 unique m6A peaks with 779-associated modified genes appeared in the keloid. In the RNA-sequencing, there were 847 genes significantly changed between these groups, transcriptionally. The genes with m6A methylated modification and the upregulated differentially expressed genes between two tissues were both mainly related to the Wnt signaling pathway. Moreover, the hyper-m6A modified Wnt / β-catenin pathway in keloid was verified with western blotting. From immunofluorescence staining results, we found that the accumulated fibroblasts were under a hyper-m6A condition in the keloid and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was mainly activated in the fibroblasts. Conclusion: The fibroblasts in the keloid were under a cellular hyper-m6A methylated condition, and the hyper-m6A modified highly-expressed Wnt / β-catenin pathway in the dermal fibroblasts might promote the pathogenesis of keloid.",

However, the functional significance of this locus in keloid pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we found that rs1348270, an enhancer located SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs873549, mediated looping with the promoter of a lncRNA DEIK (Down Expressed In Keloids, formerly RP11-400N13.1). The risk variant was associated with decreased enhancer-promoter interaction and DEIK expression. Mechanistically, downregulation of DEIK increased the expression of collagens and chondrocyte and osteocyte associated genes such as POSTN and COMP through upregulating BMP2. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed that DEIK expression was inversely correlated with BMP2, POSTN and COMP expression in keloid and normal fibroblasts. These findings uncover new mechanisms underlying genetic factor-mediated keloid predisposition and identify potential targets for keloid therapies.",

    "Summary": "Aberrant deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) resulting in dermal fibrosis is a hallmark of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Evidence suggests that dysfunctional SSc keratinocytes may contribute to fibrosis by altering dermal homeostasis. Whether interleukin-25 (IL-25), an IL-17 family member involved in epithelial/mesenchymal/immune cell interplay takes part in skin fibrosis is unknown. Here we address the role of IL-25 in SSc skin fibrosis. Compared to healthy donor (HD), in SSc and scleroderma-like disorders the epidermis expressed significantly lower levels of IL-25. In epidermal equivalents, IL-25 regulated several molecular pathways related to wound healing and ECM remodeling. Compared to control conditioned medium (CM), the CM from IL-25-primed keratinocytes enhanced the production by fibroblasts of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), IL-6, IL-8 (p< 0.05), but not of type-I collagen (Col-I ) nor fibronectin. However, IL- 25 significantly reduced the production of Col-I when applied directly to fibroblasts. The activation of keratinocytes by IL-25 was receptor-dependent and evident after a very short incubation time (10 min), largely mediated by IL-1, suggesting enhanced and specific release of preformed mediators. These results show that IL-25 participates to skin homeostasis and its decreased expression in SSc may contribute to skin fibrosis by favoring ECM deposition over degradation.",

    "Summary": "Due to limited availability of proper models to study keloid development, the underlying pathomechanisms of this severe skin disease is still poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell sequencing of keloids and identified the occurrence of a so far unrecognized keloidal Schwann cell population, remaining in the scar tissue after wound healing. In contrast to normal skin, keloidal Schwann cells possess a repair-like phenotype and high cellular plasticity. Our data reveal that keloidal Schwann cells directly contribute to the formation of the extracellular matrix and affect M2 polarization of macrophages. Indeed, we show that macrophages in keloids predominantly display a M2 polarization and produce factors inhibiting Schwann cell differentiation. Our data suggest that this cross-talk contribute to the infinite growth of keloids and that targeting Schwann cells might represent a novel treatment option for keloids.",

    "Summary": "Purpose: To explore the potential integrated molecular network by long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS in keloid fibroblast Methods: Using primary cultured keloid-derived fibroblasts (sample 0), small interfering RNAs were designed and transfected into two keloid fibroblast samples (samples 1 and 2) to knockdown HOXA11-AS. One nonspecific transfection control (sample 3) and one blank control (sample 4) were used to remove nonspecific overlap from the studied group. The lncRNAs, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) of five samples were sequenced to identify differentially expressed (DE) profiles in HOXA11-AS-knockdown keloid fibroblasts in samples 1 and 2, which facilitated removal of overlap with the nonspecific controls (samples 3 and 4). Using stepwise bioinformatic analysis, DE lncRNA and mRNAs characterized by close and natural antisense relationship were constructed into an interactive network by bioinformatic analysis. Based on this network, a lncRNA–mRNA–protein interaction network was extended by integration of the human protein–protein interaction (PPI) network. The Page Rank algorithm was used to score each mRNA in the extended LMN network to reveal significant functioning genes. Next, screened genes were validated by real-time PCR and western blot ting. Validated genes were used to construct a competing endogenous network based on DE miRNA profiles. Results: SNED1, NIPAL3, and VTN were detected significantly changed in HOXA11-AS-knockdown keloid fibroblasts. Only NIPAL3 was predicted to be involved in an intergated network for HOXA11-AS via three competing endogenous miRNAs (hsa-miRNA-19a-3p, hsa-miR-141-3p, and hsa-miR-140- 5p).

    "Summary": "Objectives: The transcription factor TFAM is controlling the transcription of core proteins required for mitochondrial homeostasis. The aim of the current study was to investigate changes in TFAM expression in systemic sclerosis (SSc), to analyze mitochondrial function and to evaluate the consequences for fibroblast activation. Methods: The expression of TFAM was analyzed by immunofluorescence and Western blot. The effects of TFAM knockout were investigated in cultured fibroblasts and in bleomycin-induced skin and lung fibrosis and in TβRIact-induced skin fibrosis. Results: The expression of TFAM was downregulated in fibroblasts in SSc skin and in cultured SSc fibroblasts. The downregulation of TFAM was associated with decreased mitochondrial number and accumulation of damaged mitochondria with release of mtDNA, accumulation of deletions in mtDNA, metabolic alterations with impaired OXPHOS and release of the mitokine GDF15. Chronic, but not acute exposure of normal fibroblasts to TGFβ mimicked the finding in SSc fibroblasts with downregulation of TFAM and accumulation of mitochondrial damage. Downregulation of TFAM promotes fibroblast activation with upregulation of fibrosis-relevant GO-terms in RNASeq. Mice with fibroblast-specific knockout of TFAM are prone to fibrotic tissue remodeling with fibrotic responses even to NaCl instillation and enhanced sensitivity to bleomycin injection and TβRIact-overexpression. TFAM knockout fosters SMAD3 signaling to promote fibroblast activation. Conclusions: Alterations in the key mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM in response to prolonged activation of TGFβ and associated mitochondrial damage induce transcriptional programs that promote fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and drive tissue fibrosis.",

    "Summary": "Background: The pathophysiology of keloid formation is not yet understood, so the identification of biomarkers for kelod can be one step towards designing new targeting therapies which will improve outcomes for patients with keloids or at risk of developing keloids. Methods: In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, weighted co-expression network analysis, and differential expression analysis of keloids based on public databases. And 3 RNA sequencing data from keloid patients in our center were used for validation. Besides, we performed QRT-PCR on keloid tissue and adjacent normal tissues from 16 patients for further verification. Results: We identified the sensitive biomarker of keloid: Tenascin-C (TNC). Then, Pseudotime analysis found that the expression level of TNC decreased first, then stabilized and finally increased with fibroblast differentiation, suggesting that TNC may play an potential role in fibroblast differentiation. In addition, there were differences in the infiltration level of macrophages M0 between the TNC-high group and the TNC-low group. Macrophages M0 had a higher infiltration level in low TNC- group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Our results can provide a new idea for the diagnosis and treatment of keloid.",

We also uncovered MCHR1 as a hub gene with the highest centrality degree in the network analysis, suggesting important biological role. We identified PDGF as the pro-fibrotic growth factor that increases MCHR1 levels.

    "Summary": "Scars are a heterogeneous disease including normotrophic scars, hypertrophic scars, and keloids. Of these lesions, keloids are a distinct subtype from any other type of scar because clinically, it causes pain, itching, or tenderness, causing life discomfort and characteristically irreversible. Therefore, for accurate diagnosis and treatment of keloids, it is essential to identify keloid-specific genes. However, in previous studies, keloids were compared with controls such as scar-free normal skin. In these studies, general scar-related genes were likely to be chosen rather than keloid-specific genes. In this study, we acquired transcriptomic profiles of normotrophic scars, hypertrophic scars, and keloids from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human skin samples using high-throughput RNA-sequencing techniques. We compared the transcriptome profile of keloids with those of other scar lesions to select for highly accurate keloid-specific genes and pathways. The results revealed that genes related with several biological processes such as sensory/visual perception are upregulated strongly in keloids, whereas genes related with activation of immune response were downregulated remarkably in keloids. Furthermore, the biological process of extracellular matrix organization was highlighted in both hypertrophic scars and keloids. In conclusion, our study provides insight into the pathogenesis of keloids distinct from other scar lesions as well as potential keloid-specific biomarkers.",

    "Summary": "Inflammation is one of the main pathological features leading to skin fibrosis and a key factor leading to the progression of skin fibrosis. Acidosis caused by a decrease in extracellular pH is a sign of the inflammatory process. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are ligand-gated ion channels on the cell membrane that sense the drop in extracellular pH. However, the molecular mechanisms by which skin fibroblasts are regulated by Acid-sensing ion channel 3(ASIC3) remain unknown. This study investigated whether ASIC3 is related to inflammation and skin fibrosis and explored the underlying mechanisms. We demonstrate that Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is a direct target of ASIC3, and ASIC3 activation promotes M-CSF transcriptional regulation of macrophages for M2 polarization. The polarization of M2 macrophages transduced by the ASIC3-M-CSF signal promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts through transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), thereby producing ASIC3-M-CSF-TGF-β1 positive feedback loop. Targeting ASIC3 may be a new treatment strategy for skin fibrosis.",

    "Summary": "RNA sequencing has been performed to investigate the transcriptomic profile of keratinocyte derived from keloid and normal skin tissue. Keratinocytes of low passage (p2-4) were cultured onto T25 flasks until full confluence was reached. Keratinocytes were then harvested by trypsinization using 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and washed in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit protocol. Samples were then sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF) where 1μg of RNA was submitted for next-generation sequencing. Once raw data returned, bioinformatics analyses were conducted. Through RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis, 252 differentially expressed genes were identified in keloid keratinocytes compared to normal skin keratinocytes. Further gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that changes in tight junctions and dysregulated response to viral infection were associated with keloid epithelia and may be linked to the disease. The results of the transcriptome analysis intimate that keloid derived keratinocytes exhibit an abnormal gene expression profile and the abnormalities in keloid keratinocytes may have an important role in keloid pathogenesis.",

Results: The appearance of 14,791 new m6A peaks in the HS sample was accompanied by the disappearance of 7,835 peaks. The unique m6A-related genes in HS were thus associated with fibrosis-related pathways.

Interestingly, we also found increasing mesenchymal fibroblast subpopulation in scleroderma, another skin fibrotic disease.Function studies showed that the mesenchymal fibroblasts promoted collagen synthesis of the other fibroblasts in keloid partiallythrough secreting POSTN.

    "Summary": "Despite recent advances in understanding skin scarring, mechanisms triggering hypertrophic scar formation are still poorly understood. In the present study we performed single-cell sequencing of mature human hypertrophic scars and developing scars in mice. Compared to normal skin, we found significant differences in gene expression in most cell types present in scar tissue. Fibroblasts (FBs) showed the most prominent alterations in gene expression, displaying a distinct fibrotic signature. By comparing genes upregulated in murine FBs during scar development with genes highly expressed in mature human hypertrophic scars, we identified a group of serine proteases, tentatively involved in scar formation. Two of them, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) and urokinase (PLAU), were further analyzed in functional assays, revealing a role in TGFβ1-mediated myofibroblast differentiation and over-production of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) without interfering with the canonical TGFβ1 -signaling pathway. In this study, we delineate the genetic landscape of hypertrophic scars and present new insights into mechanisms involved in hypertrophic scar formation. Our data suggest the use of serine protease inhibitors for the treatment of skin fibrosis. ",

    "Summary": "Skin fibrotic disease representsa major global healthcare burden, characterized by fibroblast hyperproliferation and excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix.Fibroblasts are found to be heterogeneous in multiple fibrotic diseases,but the fibroblast heterogeneity of skin fibrotic diseases remains unknown.In this study, we performed single-cell RNA-seq in keloid, a paradigm of skin fibrotic diseases, andnormal scardermis tissues.Our results indicate that keloid and normal scar fibroblasts could be divided into 4 subpopulations: secretory-papillary, secretory-reticular, mesenchymal and pro-inflammatory.The percentage of mesenchymal fibroblast subpopulationincreased significantly in keloid compared to normal scar. Interestingly, we also found increasing mesenchymal fibroblast subpopulation in scleroderma, another skin fibrotic disease.Function studies showed that the mesenchymal fibroblasts promoted collagen synthesis of the other fibroblasts in keloid partiallythrough secreting POSTN. These findings will help us understandskin fibroticpathogenesis in depth,and provided potential target cells for fibrotic diseases therapies.",

    "Summary": "Skin and lung fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is driven by myofibroblasts, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expressing cells that produce matrix as well as increase tension on surrounding tissues. Myofibroblast progenitors have been described to arise from a variety of cell types in murine fibrosis models, but relatively modest insight is available as to their source and differentiation in fibrotic human diseases. We utilize single cell RNA-sequencing to examine the transcriptome changes that occur in fibroblasts in SSc skin and during myofibroblast differentiation. We show that dermal myofibroblasts arise from an SFRP2/DPP4-expressing progenitor fibroblast population. In SSc skin, fibroblasts undergo global changes in gene expression, including SFRP2-expressing fibroblasts, which globally upregulate expression of markers, such as PRSS23 and THBS1. However, only a fraction of SSc fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, as shown by expression of additional markers, such as SFRP4 and FNDC1. These results indicate that myofibroblasts derive from a specific fibroblast subpopulation in SSc skin, that their differentiation proceeds in two stages and that other fibroblast populations also shift transcriptomes in SSc skin, suggesting a cytokine driven process. The myofibroblast transcriptome implicates upstream transcription factors that should help further unravel the drivers of myofibroblast differentiation.",

    "Summary": "Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is a key mediator of fibroblast activation in fibrotic diseases including systemic sclerosis. Here we show that Engrailed 1 (EN1) is re-expressed in multiple fibroblast subpopulations in the skin of SSc patients. We characterize EN1 as a molecular amplifier of TGFβ signaling in myofibroblast differentiation: TGFβ induces EN1 expression in a SMAD3-dependent manner, and, in turn, EN1 mediates the pro-fibrotic effects of TGFβ. RNA sequencing demonstrates that EN1 induces a pro-fibrotic gene expression profile functionally related to the cytoskeleton organization and ROCK activation. EN1 regulates gene expression by modulating the activity of SP1 and other SP-transcription factors, as confirmed by ChIP-seq experiments for EN1 and SP1. Functional experiments confirm the coordinating role of EN1 on ROCK activity and the re-organization of cytoskeleton during myofibroblast differentiation both in standard fibroblast culture systems and in in vitro skin models. Consistently, mice with fibroblast-specific knockout of En1 demonstrate impaired fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and are partially protected from experimental skin fibrosis.",

    "Summary": "Purpose: We aimed to identify the molecular drivers that initiate or sustain keloid pathogenesis. Method: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of Asian keloid and normal tissues was performed to identify genes that contribute to keloid pathogenesis. We also established a preclinical model of inflammatory skin fibrosis by injecting C57BL/6 mice with bleomycin intradermally for 3 weeks to provide an alternative animal model of keloid scar. Result: Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of WNT5A gene expression, along with significant enrichment of genes related to EMT in keloid tissues. These results correlate with those of histological analysis in which human keloid tissues and the bleomycin-induced fibrosis animal model showed increased WNT5A expression along with EMT markers. Our in vitro data showed increased expression of the IL-6/JAK/STAT pathway and subsequent elevation in EMT markers on keratinocytes when co-cultured with WNT5A-activated fibroblasts or keloid fibroblasts. Silencing of WNT5A reversed the hyperactivation of the STAT pathway and EMT. Conclusion: IL-6 secreted from WNT5A-activated fibroblasts or keloid fibroblasts may induce adjacent keratinocytes to express EMT markers by activating the JAK/STAT signalling pathway. A better understanding of keloid pathogenesis and the role of WNT5A in EMT will promote the development of next-generation targeted treatments for keloid scars.",

    "Summary": "Keloids are wounding-induced fibroproliferative human tumor–like skin scars of complex genetic makeup and poorly defined pathogenesis. Fibroblasts are the principal mediator of fibroproliferative disorders. To reveal dynamic epigenetic and transcriptome changes of keloid fibroblasts, a vertical study from RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses followed by in vivo confirmation of candidate molecule expression and subsequent functional testing was carried out using an early passage, freshly isolated keloid fibroblast cell strain and its paired normal control. These keloid fibroblasts produce keloid-like scars in a plasma clot-based skin equivalent humanized keloid animal model. RNA-seq analysis reveals that Hepatic fibrosis is the most significant pathway followed by Wnt–b-catenin signaling, TGF-b signaling, regulation of the EMT pathway, the STAT3 pathway, and adherens junction signaling. ATAC-seq analysis shows that STAT3 signaling is the most active pathway in keloid fibroblasts, followed by Wnt signaling (Wnt5) and regulation of the EMT pathway. Immunohistochemistry confirms that activated STAT3, (Tyr705 phospho-STAT3) and/or b-catenin are upregulated in dermal fibroblasts of keloid clinical specimens and mature keloid skin equivalent implants from the humanized mouse model compared to the normal control. The effect of STAT3 signaling on keloid fibroblast collagen expression was further tested in plasma clot-based skin equivalents using Cucurbitacin I, a selective JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor. A non-linear dose response of Cucurbitacin I was observed in collagen type I expression indicating a likely role of STAT3 signaling pathway in keloid pathogenesis. This work also demonstrates the utility of the recently established humanized keloid mouse model in exploring the mechanism of keloid formation.",

    "Summary": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc - scleroderma) is a multi-system, fibrotic disease affecting skin and internal organs. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) involves the differential usage of polyadenylation signals, which gives rise to transcripts with variable 3'UTR length. The mammalian Cleavage factor I 25kDa subunit (CFIm25, encoded by NUDT21) is a key regulator of alternative polyadenylation APA and its depletion causes predominantly 3'UTR shortening through loss of stimulation of distal polyA sites resulting in increased used of proximal polyA sites. A shortened 3'UTR will often lack microRNA target sites, resulting in increased mRNA translation due to evasion of microRNA-mediated gene repression. Herein, we report that CFlm25 is downregulated in SSc skin, and primary dermal fibroblasts, andas well as in two murine models of dermal fibrosis.The purpose of this experiment is to identify the APA targets of CFIm25 in human skin fibroblasts. Following the knockdown of CFIm25 in normal human skin fibroblasts, we identified 971 genes with shortened 3’UTRs, including those involved in the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway.",

An electric shaver was used to shave the interscapular region on the back of each mouse, and a non-toxic permanent marker was used to draw two small circles on the skin within the shaved area on each mouse. Fibrosis was induced by daily subcutaneous injections of either bleomycin (10mg/kg/day; 100Î¼l per injection site of 1mg/ml solution for these ~20gm mice) or PBS (vehicle control) within the marked interscapular regions. Injections began on Day 0 and were done five times per week for two weeks, using a 27-gauge needle.

    "Summary": "Several lines of evidence have shown that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) may play a role in the pathophysiology of systemic sclerosis (SSc). Thereby, structurally different dual PPARγ/CB2 agonists such as VCE-004.8 and Ajulemic acid (AjA) have been shown to alleviate skin fibrosis and inflammation in experimental models of SSc. Since both compounds are currently being tested in humans, we were interested to identify similarities and differences in a murine model of SSc. One method available to assess this is the pharmacotranscriptomic signature of the individual compounds. To analyze the pharmacotranscriptomic signature, we used RNA-Seq to analyze the skin gene expression changes from bleomycin-induced fibrosis in mice treated orally with either AjA or EHP-101, a lipidic formulation of VCE-004.8. While both compounds prevented the upregulation of a common group of genes involved in the inflammatory and fibrotic components of the disease and the pharmacotranscriptomic signatures were similar for both compounds in some pathways, we found key differences between the compounds in several functional groups, including genes related the hypoxia, interferon-α and interferon-γ response. Additionally, we found 28 specific genes with translation potential by comparing our results with a list of intrinsic human scleroderma genes. Inmunohistochemical analysis revealed that both EHP-101 and AjA prevented bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis, collagen accumulation, and TNC and VCAM expression. However, only EHP-101 normalized the reduced expression of vascular CD31, CD34 and Von Willebrand factor markers, which parallels skin fibrosis, while AjA did not affect these markers. Finally, clear differences were also found in the plasmatic biomarker analysis, in which we found that EHP-101, but not AjA, enhanced the expression of some factors related to angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Altogether the results indicate that dual PPARγ/CB2 agonists qualify as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of SSc and other fibrotic diseases as well, and that EHP-101 has unique mechanisms of action related to the pathophysiology of SSc which could be beneficial in treatment of this complex disease with no current therapeutic options.",

    "Summary": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) or scleroderma is a chronic multiorgan autoimmune disease of unknown etiology characterized by vascular, immunological and fibrotic abnormalities. Several lines of evidence have shown that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) may play a role in the pathophysiology of SSc. VCE-004.8, a CBD aminoquinone derivative, is a dual PPARγ/CB2 that alleviates bleomycin (BLM)-induced skin fibrosis. Herein we report that EHP-101, an oral lipidic formulation of VCE-004.8, prevents skin and lung fibrosis and collagen accumulation in BLM challenged mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the skin demonstrate that EHP-101 prevents macrophage infiltration, and the expression of Tenascin C (TNC), VCAM, and the α-smooth muscle actin (SMA). In addition, a reduced expression of vascular CD31, paralleling skin fibrosis, was also prevented by EHP-101. RNAseq analysis in skin biopsies showed a clear effect of EHP-101 in the inflammatory and epithelial-mesenchymal transition transcriptomic signatures. TGF-beta regulated genes such as matrix metalloproteinase-3 (Mmp3), cytochrome b-245 heavy chain (Cybb), lymphocyte antigen 6E (Ly6e), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (Vcam1) and the Integrin alpha-5 (Itga5) were induced in BLM mice and repressed by EHP-101 treatment. We also intersected differentially expressed genes in EHP-101-treated mice with dataset of human scleroderma intrinsic genes and found 53 overlapped genes, including the C-C motif chemokine 2 (Ccl2) and the interleukin 13 receptor subunit alpha 1 (IL-13Ra1) genes, which have been studied as biomarkers of SSc. Altogether the results indicate that this synthetic cannabinoid qualifies as a novel compound for the management and possible treatment of scleroderma and, potentially, other fibrotic diseases.",

    "Summary": "Keloids represent a common form of exaggerated wound scarring that cause considerable morbidity. Moreover, there are limited data on molecular mechanisms underlying keloids and effective therapies are lacking. To gain new insight in the transcriptomic alterations of wound healing in keloid-prone individuals, we followed an integrative approach of RNA-Seq and miRNA expression data analysis in serial skin biopsies of the same site (baseline and six weeks after wounding) in keloid-prone (n=8) and healthy matched control individuals (n=6). Bioinformatic analysis identified 37 miRNAs and 1449 genes that are differentially expressed specifically in keloid-prone individuals during wound healing. Pathway enrichment analysis was undertaken in the RNA-Seq data and identified NOTCH signaling, MAPK signaling, and Toll-like receptor pathways to be altered in keloid-prone individuals after wounding. In addition, dysregulation of DNA repair, p53 signalling and metabolic pathways (RNA, protein, fructose, mannose and glycerophospholipid metabolism) was highlighted during keloid formation. Gene association network analysis demonstrated divergent average expression profiles of cytokine signaling genes, as well as lipid metabolism genes between keloid-prone and healthy individuals during wound healing. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive and integrative analysis of the keloid transcriptome and miRNAome and highlights biological pathways that feature during keloid formation.",

Using the bleomycin-induced mouse model of SSc, we identified a distinct high dermal collagen bundle alignment gene signature, characterized by a concerted upregulation in cell migration, adhesion, and guidance pathways, and downregulation of spindle, replication, and cytokinesis pathways. Furthermore, increased bundle alignment induced a cell migration gene signature in fibroblasts in vitro, and these cells demonstrated increased directed migration on aligned ECM fibers that is dependent on expression of Arhgdib (Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2). Our results indicate that increased cell migration is a cellular response to the increased collagen bundle alignment featured in fibrotic skin.
